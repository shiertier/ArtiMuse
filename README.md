## 🔍 Abstract



The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and professional understanding.  
 
In this paper, we present:  
**(1) ArtiMuse**, an innovative MLLM-based IAA model with Joint Scoring and Expert-Level Understanding capabilities;  
**(2) ArtiMuse-10K**, the first expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with 8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score.
